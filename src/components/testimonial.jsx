       <p>I chose ALLEN Online Courses because I <br/>wanted to balance my NEET prep with my<br/> school schedule. The course structure,<br/> from daily homework to post-class<br/> handouts, was well-organized.</p>
       <p>I took NEET in 2023 but didn’t achieve my<br/> desired score, so I reattempted in 2024 with<br/> ALLEN Online Courses. The top-quality<br/> faculty, study material, & personalised<br/> experience on the ALLEN app helped me<br/> improve my score.</p>
       <p>I wanted to stay with my family while<br/> preparing for JEE, so I chose ALLEN Online<br/> Courses. The faculty was great & the live <br/>classes, daily homework & test series helped<br/> me secure a great score & rank!</p>
       <p>I came to know about ALLEN’s Online Test<br/> Series from my senior in school. The tests are<br/> really awesome as these are based mainly on <br/>NCERT and cover almost all types of NEET<br/> questions. They gave me the real feel of the<br/> competition.</p>
